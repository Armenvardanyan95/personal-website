<h1>Open Source</h1>

<p>I have contributed to several open source projects, mainly to 
    <a href="https://github.com/ngrx/platform" target="_blank">NgRx</a>, and also made some minor contributions 
    to <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs" target="_blank">RxJS</a>. I also wrote a small library of custom operators for 
    RxJS called
    <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sareer" target="_blank">sareer</a>
